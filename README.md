# Furnace Recipe
Furnace with configurable recipe for Factorio

## Motivation
Gives you control about what furnaces are smelting.
First: Mods such as [Crafting Efficiency](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/crafting-efficiency) need a furnace with recipe selector. Other mods such as Bob's assembly machines introduced the Chemical Mixing Furnace, but only in combination with additional resource types. But only the furnace was wanted. This is why this mod exists.
Second: Belt poisoning is no big deal anymore. Furnaces won't load accidentially dropped items on the belt such as iron plates instead of iron ore which would block the furnace forever.

## Compatibility
- Can use the Furnaces from [bobassembly](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/bobassembly) can be used to craft the Multi Furnace with in all levels. (Careful: Depending on the settings, each recipe ends in a unsatisfying crafting deadend)

## Settings
There are some options to configure the mod for your needs.

| Setting name | Description | Default |
| ------------ | ---------- | -------- |
 | Add additional furnace levels | Adds better furnace tiers 2 and 3 | Off |
| Own crafting branch | Adds a craftig branch that crafts Multi Furnace 1 from the original electric furnace and the additional levels from their previous ones | On |
| Craft from Bob's furnaces | Adds recipes to craft Multi Furnaces from Bob's non-multi counter parts on the same level. Be careful: You cannot use a Multi Furnace to craft Bob's next level furnace. Implicitly enables "Craft from Bob's level 3 furnace" | Off |
| Craft from Bob's level 3 furnace | Allow Multi Furnace 3 to be crafted from Bob's Furnace 3 (previous levels are not implicitly craftable by this setting) | Off |

## How to install
